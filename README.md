XSLT-Snippets
=============

guuids.xsl

An XSLT 1 native generator of 128 bit GUUID's using a Lagged Fibonaccipseudo-random number 
generator and someother templates copy-pasted together from the internet.

Need to work on this but, its a start

Don't use this in production, unless time isn't an issue. 
It takes quite some time to proess the initial seed values for the LFG
